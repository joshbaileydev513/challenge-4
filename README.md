# Weekly Challenge 4

## Description

The motivation behind this weekly challenge was about helping familiarize ourselves with the tests & coding challenges that come with looking for a job.  The goal was to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions that will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface along with demonstrating my new skills within Web API's.

In this specific challenge, the User Story was: AS A coding boot camp student, I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores,  SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers. The main acceptance criteria were as follows:

- GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
- WHEN I click the start button
- THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
- WHEN I answer a question
- THEN I am presented with another question
- WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
- THEN time is subtracted from the clock
- WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
- THEN the game is over
- WHEN the game is over
- THEN I can save my initials and my score

The main goal this would be to create a dynamically responsive web application that will mimic coding tests we could see in potential future interviews. Additionally, we can use it as a device to show our peers just how much we have learned in JavaScript so far! 

Through this fourth challenge, I learned multiple hands on skils that will be used within the modern software development lifecycle and environment. I was able to use JavAscript and Web API's to perform this dynamically respsonsive web application which will only hone my skills for future builds. 

## Installation

Or you can view the live page here: https://joshbaileydev513.github.io/challenge-4/

## Usage

To use the main functionality of this page, you will click on the start button which will then be followed by timed coding qusetions. When you answer a question correct, you are then presented with another question. When an answer is incorrect, a deduction of time is made from the remaining time as a penalty. When all qustions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the game is over. This is when the secondary fucntionality comes along and you recieve your score. You are then prompted for your initials to save both of those on the High Score page. This High Score page can be found in the top left of the page at all times for viewing.
